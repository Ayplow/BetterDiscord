<b>Description:</b><i> A theme to keep away clutter while staying in Discord's style and color.</i><br>
<b>Status:</b> <i>In development.</i> I am very much a perfectionist, and would love any suggestions at MoreThanTom#0828, I will try to keep it updated to work with latest Discord/BetterDiscord updates.<br>
<b>What it does:</b>
<p>So far, this theme shrinks the guilds, channels, members and search results off the screen when not in use, adds transparency layers to a few panels including Mentions, and the search Bar. There are also a couple more QoL tweaks here and there. I have been careful to make sure all the hitboxes are exact, and I havent left any graphical glitches, However, if you do find anything, please tell me so that I can fix it.</p>
